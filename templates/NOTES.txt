{{- if eq .Values.config.storage.engine "chunks" }}
Cortex chunks storage has been deprecated, and it's now in maintenance mode: all Cortex users are encouraged to migrate to the blocks storage.
No new features will be added to the chunks storage.
Unlike the official cortex default configuration this helm-chart does not run the chunk engine by default.
